This entire portfolio is powered by Markdown, not a CMS or a collection of React components. Just simple `.mdx` files.  
Here’s why that approach makes sense.

## Simplicity First

I wanted to write content, not manage components or props. Markdown gives me that direct, minimal writing experience.  
It feels like working in a personal notebook that just happens to render as a full website.

No setup, no extra tooling, no distraction.

Just:

```bash
---
title: Hello World
date: 17 October, 2025
---
My first blog post.
```

And it becomes a page.

## MDX: Markdown with React Superpowers

Markdown is great for text, but I still wanted to add React components where needed: interactive elements, code demos, or custom UI blocks.

That’s why I use MDX with Next.js.

MDX lets me mix content and components naturally:

```mdx
Here’s a counter inside a blog post:

<Counter />
```

This allows me to build interactive sections without leaving the Markdown flow.

## Easy Version Control

All my posts are stored as `.mdx` files, which means they work seamlessly with Git.  
I can track changes, create branches for drafts, and push updates like any other code commit.

No database, no CMS dashboard, no authentication layers.  
If I want to publish, I commit and deploy.

## Performance and Portability

Since the site is built at compile time, every page is static.  
That means fast load times, no runtime dependencies, and easy hosting.

I can deploy it to Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any static hosting service.  
It’s lightweight and future-proof.

## Developer Aesthetic

Writing Markdown feels natural. It’s how developers document projects, write READMEs, and take notes.

There’s no need for a visual editor when I can stay inside my code environment and keep full control over structure and styling.

## The Stack

Here’s what powers the site:

- Next.js for the framework  
- next-mdx-remote (or @next/mdx) for Markdown + React support  
- Tailwind CSS for styling  
- Framer Motion for animations  

That’s the full setup.  
No CMS, no plugins, no unnecessary complexity.

## Closing Thoughts

Building this site in Markdown keeps everything simple, flexible, and version-controlled.  
It’s a reminder that sometimes, the simplest tools are still the best, especially when they integrate perfectly into a developer workflow.
