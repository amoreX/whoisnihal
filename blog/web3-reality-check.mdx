title: web3 isn't what you think it is
description: The gap between the web3 dream and what we actually got

Everyone sold you a dream. Decentralization. Ownership. Freedom from big tech. The future of the internet.

And then we got... jpegs of apes.

## The Original Promise

The pitch was compelling. A new internet where:

- You own your data
- No single company controls the platform
- Censorship-resistant applications
- Trustless transactions without intermediaries
- True digital ownership

Sounds revolutionary. The kind of thing worth building.

But somewhere between the whitepaper and reality, something went wrong.

## What We Actually Built

Let's look at what web3 became in practice:

### Centralized "Decentralization"

Most dApps rely on Infura or Alchemy for node access. When AWS goes down, so does "decentralized" finance. OpenSea became the de facto NFT marketplace - a single point of failure for an ecosystem that was supposed to eliminate single points of failure.

The irony is brutal.

### Ownership Theater

You "own" your NFT, but:

- The image is hosted on a regular server that can go offline
- The marketplace can delist you
- The smart contract owner can often modify terms
- Your "ownership" is a pointer to a URL that might 404 tomorrow

That's not ownership. That's a receipt with extra steps.

### The Speculation Machine

Web3 was supposed to enable new business models. Instead, it became the most efficient speculation machine ever built.

Every token launch follows the same pattern:
1. Promise revolutionary tech
2. Create artificial scarcity
3. Early insiders accumulate
4. Retail buys the hype
5. Dump

Repeat until the next narrative cycle.

## The Technical Reality

Here's what nobody talks about at conferences:

**Scalability is still unsolved.** Ethereum does ~15 transactions per second. Visa does 65,000. Layer 2 solutions help, but they reintroduce the centralization we were trying to escape.

**UX is terrible.** Gas fees, wallet management, seed phrases, transaction signing - every interaction is friction. Normal users don't want to think about any of this.

**Immutability is a bug, not a feature.** When code is law, bugs become permanent. The DAO hack showed us that "code is law" only applies until enough money is at stake, then we fork and pretend decentralization still matters.

## What Web3 Got Right

It's not all bad. Some genuine innovations emerged:

- **Programmable money** - Smart contracts are genuinely useful for specific applications
- **Permissionless innovation** - Anyone can build without asking permission
- **Transparent systems** - On-chain data is auditable by anyone
- **New coordination mechanisms** - DAOs, despite their flaws, showed new ways to organize

## The Path Forward

Web3 doesn't need more hype. It needs builders who:

1. Focus on real problems, not token speculation
2. Admit when centralized solutions are better
3. Prioritize UX over ideological purity
4. Build sustainable business models

The technology has potential. But potential doesn't ship products.

## Closing Thoughts

Web3 isn't dead. It's just not what the marketing promised.

The next generation of builders will need to separate the useful primitives from the speculation theater. Use blockchain where it makes sense. Use traditional infrastructure where it doesn't.

Stop drinking the kool-aid. Start building things that work.

The future isn't decentralized or centralized. It's whatever actually solves problems for real users.

And right now, that's not a jpeg of an ape.
